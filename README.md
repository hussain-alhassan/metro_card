# The Oyster Card Problem (Metro Card System)

- This is a fare card system which is a limited version of London’s Oyster card system.
- The user has a card with £30 balance initially.
- Balance is deducted after every trip.

To run it from a Mac:
- Open a Terminal window.
- clone the project by running below command
```
git clone git@github.com:hussain-alhassan/metro_card.git
```
- Navigate to metro_card folder.
- run
```
python3 main.py
```
Note: you have to have python 3 installed

main.py is just the main file that will call functions from the classes

- Then the software will guid you through the menu
